This package implements several collaborative filtering (recommendation) algorithms. 
- Probabilistic Matrix Factorization (PMF) (regularized SVD)
- Bayesian Probabilistic Matrix Factorization (BPMF)
- Bayesian Probabilistic Tensor/Temporal Factorization (BPTF)

The included data files TTr and TTe contains 4% random subset of the Netflix training set.

Free for research purposes. No warranty is provided.

You need a recently version of Matlab and a mex-supported C compiler to run this package.
For a quick demo, just run demo.m.
